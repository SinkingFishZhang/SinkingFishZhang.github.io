Dear Garden Visitors,

<br>

welcome to my gallery of thoughts!

Since 2022, I have been working as a frontend graphics development engineer and responsible for the development of a B/S software for drawing the geological distribution of oil reservoirs. Gifted with 2D and 3D geometry talenty since I was young, this job is exactly what I wanted. For improving myself, I d like to take notes of what I have learned and researched during the work

For copyright issue, the original code in the project will not appear in the article, but will be replaced by pseudo code. Similarly for source code research, it will be presented as pseudo code unless the library is open-sourced

At the beginning of the blog, I would like to express my gratitude to my manager Mr. Wang, who helped me change to this graphics development team, and thus led to the birth of this blog.

As the article becomes richer, I gonna build a pseudo code dictionary to make it easier for everyone to read.

If you have any questions and suggestions, or if you also want to become a sharer, please don't hesitate to write to me [zcy0627@outlook.com](zcy0627@outlook.com)

Best,

Garden Manager
